# kicad-packages3D-source

This repository contains source files for the 3D models found at https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-packages3d

These source files can be in the form of:

* **Scripts** - Scripts used to parametrically generate model files
* **Native 3D model Files** - e.g. FreeCad or Solidworks models, (etc)

Please note that there will be preference for scripted and free open source program generated models due to maintenance reasons.

Also, even though models produced with proprietary software are accepted, the final file export should be made in FreeCAD using StepUp.
